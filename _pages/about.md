Hello! My name is Mohitvishnu, but most people call me [Mohit](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zrve6q8AAAAJ).

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Oregon State University, working with [Prof. Alan Fern](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/alan-fern) in the [Dynamic Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (DRAIL)](https://mime.engineering.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/). My research focuses on reinforcement learning, embodied AI, and vision-based locomotion for bipedal robots and multi-agent systems.

In Summer 2025, I interned at Amazon Robotics (Lab126), where I developed an agentic AI framework for mobile manipulation using LLM-driven hierarchical planning and visuomotor control.

Previously, I worked on multiagent aerial robotics at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in the [AIRL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1luTfMp6TwYpOogOe0SyA) and [GCDSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IISc_Guidance,_Control_and_Decision_Systems_Laboratory) labs under [Prof. Suresh Sundaram](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/suresh-sundaram/) and [Prof. Debashish Ghose](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/), and participated in the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC).

I earned my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from RGUKT AP-IIIT, Nuzvid. An early internship at IISc's UAV lab with [Dr. S. N. Omkar](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/s-n-omkar/) deepened my interest in robotics.
