Hello! I am Mohit. I’m currently exploring the cutting-edge field of robotics as a Ph.D. candidate at the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute, Oregon State University, under the insightful guidance of Prof. Alan Fern in the Dynamic Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (DRAIL).

My research is driven by a profound interest in Reinforcement Learning and its application to dynamic legged locomotion. I am dedicated to developing innovative planning and control strategies that enable bipedal robots to navigate rough terrain with unprecedented agility and efficiency. Beyond individual robot capabilities, my work extends into the fascinating realm of multi-agent robotics, focusing on aerial systems. This journey is fueled by a vision to create robotic systems that can work collaboratively to accomplish complex tasks and significantly impact our world.

My path to Ph.D. research was paved with hands-on experience in multi-agent and aerial robotics at both the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory (AIRL) and the Guidance Control and Decision-making Laboratory (GCDSL) at the Indian Institute of Science. Working under the leadership of Prof. Suresh Sundaram and Prof. Debashish Ghose, respectively, I honed my skills in designing algorithms and systems that allow robots to work in concert, a critical aspect of modern robotics. Additionally, my participation in the prestigious Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) offered me invaluable experience in competitive robotics, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in autonomous robotics.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering from Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT AP-IIIT), Nuzvid. An internship at the UAV lab with Dr. SN Omkar further fueled my passion for robotics, setting me on my current path.

I am eager to share my journey and discoveries with a broader audience. Whether you are a fellow researcher, a student diving into the world of robotics, or someone curious about the technological advancements shaping our future, I welcome you to connect. Let’s explore the possibilities and challenges of robotics together, driving innovation for a better tomorrow.
