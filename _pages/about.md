Hello! I am Mohit. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Oregon State University, advised by [Prof. Alan Fern](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/alan-fern) in the [Dynamic Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (DRAIL)](https://mime.engineering.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/). My research focuses on reinforcement learning, embodied AI, and vision-based locomotion for legged robots and multi-agent systems. I explore approaches in robot learning, combining vision-based reinforcement learning with robust control and planning techniques. My reserach aims to equip robots with the adaptability and precision required to operate seamlessly in diverse environments.

Previously, I worked on multiagent systems and aerial robotics at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). This research was conducted at the [AIRL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1luTfMp6TwYpOogOe0SyA) and [GCDSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IISc_Guidance,_Control_and_Decision_Systems_Laboratory) labs under the guidance of [Prof. Suresh Sundaram](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/suresh-sundaram/) and [Prof. Debashish Ghose](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/). I participated in the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC), gaining valuable experience in competitive robotics.

I earned my Bachelors of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering from Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT AP-IIIT), Nuzvid. I interned at the UAV lab at IISc with [Dr. S. N. Omkar](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/s-n-omkar/), which further fueled my passion for robotics.
